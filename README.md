# Dithering Shader

A dithering shader implementation with React Three Fiber. This project demonstrates how to apply dithering and post-processing effects to 3D scenes with Three.js.

## Features

- Custom dithering effect with 4x4 pixel pattern
- Dynamic adjustment of grid size and pixel ratio
- Pre and post dithering bloom effects
- Configurable grayscale mode
- Interactive controls for all shader parameters
- 3D model with custom environment map lighting
- Responsive design

## Running

Start the application in development mode:

```bash
yarn start
```

## How the Shader Works

The dithering shader implements a halftoning technique based on a 4x4 pattern matrix.
The process works as follows:

1. The image is first pixelated based on grid size and pixel size ratio
2. Luminance is calculated for each pixel
3. Based on pixel position and luminance, a dithering pattern is applied
4. The effect can be applied in grayscale or color mode

## Controls

The interface allows adjusting various parameters:

- **Dithering Effect Resolution**: Adjusts the dithering grid size
- **Pixelation Strength**: Intensifies the pixelation effect
- **Grayscale Only**: Toggles black and white mode
- **Bloom (Pre/Post Dithering)**: Add bloom effects before or after dithering
- **Environment Settings**: Adjust lighting intensity and highlight color
